Change log for AWAPer
----------------------

13-Sept-2018
* Bug Issue #2 fixed (point extractions using only the first input coordinate). L263 of extractCatchmentData() edits.

4-April-2019
* netCDF syncing added every 365 days to makeNetCDF_file(). This was done to reduce the loss of data if the code crashed.
* tryCatch() added to linux downloading of AWAP files.

15-April-2019
* For Windows users, a trycatch() was added for 7zip not being installed. If an error is thrown, user advice is output.
* Bug fixed in the calculation of potential evapotranspiration which caused termination. The maximum acceptable data gaps
  was changed from c(20,20,20) to c(99,99,99) and the user was given the option to control which types of data gaps are interpolated.

3-June-2019
* Run-time for the extaction of ET data (using extractCatchmentData()) was significantly reduced by using Evapotranspiration package v1.14 or later. extractCatchmentData() was edited to suppress unnecessary messaging and post-processing by Evapotranspiration.
* Major bug was fixed that caused the solar radiation grids to be flipped vertically.

4-November-2019
* Documentation and code edited to pass "R CMD check --as-cran"  without errors or warnings.
* User prompt added if updating netCDFs when the start date is 1/1/1900.

26-July-2020
* Userdefined time steps added
* Spatial can data returned at a user defined time step
* Bugs fixed in calling xts::index.

6-Aug-2020
* Input for interpolation method rearranged in the calling of raster::extract()
* Input 'interpMethod' added to extractCatchmentData(). This addresses isse request #17 https://github.com/peterson-tim-j/AWAPer/issues/17

14-Aug-2020
* Issue #19 (https://github.com/peterson-tim-j/AWAPer/issues/19) fixed so that NODATA codes that chnage with time are handled.

15-Aug-2020
* Bug fixed in calling xts::period.apply within extractCatchmentData().
* gridded() updated to sp::gridded() within extractCatchmentData().
* Decsription file updated with ORCIDs.
* Citation to paper updated.

22-Aug-2020
* Bug fixed with input updateTo=NA to makeNetCDF_file(). Update now correctly updates netCDF grids to yesterday.
* Documentation example for makeNetCDF_file() extended to show updating of netCDFs.
* Badges added to README.md

12-Sep-2020
* Import R.utils replaced with utils
* Finish message added to makeNetCDF

13-Sep-2020
* LICENSE.md rebuilt to resolve 'note' in CRAN submission.

15-Sept-2020
* catchments.rda data re-saved to version 3.
* R version requirement updated to>=3.5.

30-Oct-2020
* Bug #21 fixed (ie check for getSolarrad=F but when getET=T)
* check added to ensure solarrad netCDF is provided when calculated ET when needed.
* One vignette added to demonstrate extraction of point precip.

Nov 7 2020
* vignette build locally to reduce installation time. The vignette was prebuilt using the commmand "knitr::knit("Point_rainfall.Rmd.orig", output = "Point_rainfall.Rmd")" following https://ropensci.org/technotes/2019/12/08/precompute-vignettes/

Nov 9 2020
* System maximum file download time increased from the default of 60 sec to 300 sec (requested by Em. Prof. Brian Ripley)
* Citation author format updated.

Dec 30 2020
* Example removed from getDEM(). This was done to reduce the build time when \donttest{} example code is ignored.
* Example removed from extractCatchmentData(), specifically the ET exmaple. This was done to reduce the build time when \donttest{} example code is ignored.
* Warning removed from extractCatchmentData() re variable name not set when extracting time points.
* Pre-compiled vignette added (see Catchment_avg_ET_rainfall.Rmd.orig)

11 Feb 2021
* Bug fixed in extractCatchmentData() that caused an error when ET was estimated for a single grid point
* Bug fixed in extractCatchmentData() that caused an error when the source data (other that solar radiation) had a data-gap and ET was estimated. This was resolved  by interpolatiing the point using 'DoY average'.

17 Feb 2021
* major bug fixed in extractCatchmentData() arising from raster::rasterize throwing an error when the raster grid is large (see https://github.com/rspatial/raster/issues/192). The was resolved here by cropping the AWAP raster to the catchment polygon extent (using snap='out'). For details see https://github.com/peterson-tim-j/AWAPer/blob/5fff85dc5665489d39e56fab86237f30ce4a78a8/R/extractCatchmentData.R#L435 . Note,  work around may not work when the polygon area (i.e. catchment boundary) is a large fraction of the Australian land area.

22 Apr 2024
 * File downloads in download.ASCII.file.R changed to use RCurl package

15 Feb 2025
* maptools package deprecation replaced with sf package.
* Check added during extaction for non-NA catchment IDs and being unique.

16 Feb 2025
* Error in ET estimation omitted site elevation and coordinates. Bug fixed.
